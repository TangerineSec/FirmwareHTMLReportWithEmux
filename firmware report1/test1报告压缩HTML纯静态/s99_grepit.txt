[[0;34m+[0m] [0;36m[1mIntelligent grepit module[0m
[1m=================================================================[0m
This module tries to identify interesting areas within the firmware with the tool grepit from the CRASS (code review audit script scanner) toolbox.
The grepit module name starts with a priority value between 1-9, where 1 is more interesting (low false positive rate, certainty of vulnerability) and 9 is only something you might want to have a look when you are desperately looking for vulnerabilities

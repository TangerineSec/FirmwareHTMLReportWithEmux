1 write(2,0x401fb0,1016)Usage: mtd [<options> ...] <command> [<arguments> ...] <device>

The device is in the format of mtdX (eg: mtd4) or its label.
mtd recognizes these commands:
        unlock                  unlock the device
        erase                   erase all data on device
        write <imagefile>|-     write <imagefile> (use - for stdin) to device
Following options are available:
        -q                      quiet mode (once: no [w] on writing,
                                           twice: no status messages)
        -r                      reboot after successful command
        -e <device>             erase <device> before executing the command
        -v                      output writing info. (1 more -v would output HTML format.)
        -o <num>                file offset 
        -l <num>                length in file
        -w                      read after write action to check
Example: To write linux.trx to mtd4 labeled as linux and reboot afterwards
         mtd -r write linux.trx linux

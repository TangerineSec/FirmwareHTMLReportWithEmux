Thought should be given to using other configurations instead: a virtual server, a port forwarding rule, or a port trigger. Virtual servers open one port for incoming sessions bound for a specific application (and also allow port redirection and the use of ALGs ). Port forwarding is rather like a selective DMZ, where incoming traffic targeted at one or more ports is forwarded to a specific LAN host (thereby not exposing as many ports as a DMZ host). Port triggering is a special form of port forwarding, which is activated by outgoing traffic, and for which ports are only forwarded while the trigger is active.",

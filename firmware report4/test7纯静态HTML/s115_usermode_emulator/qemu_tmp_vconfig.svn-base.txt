* The [interface-name] is the name of the ethernet card that hosts
  the VLAN you are talking about.
* The vlan_id is the identifier (0-4095) of the VLAN you are operating on.
* skb_priority is the priority in the socket buffer (sk_buff).
* vlan_qos is the 3 bit priority in the VLAN header
* name-type:  VLAN_PLUS_VID (vlan0005), VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD (vlan5),

              PER_KERNEL  # Forces vlan 5 to be unique across all devices.
* FLAGS:  1 REORDER_HDR  When this is set, the VLAN device will move the
            ethernet header around to make it look exactly like a real
            ethernet device.  This may help programs such as DHCPd which
            read the raw ethernet packet and make assumptions about the
            location of bytes.  If you don't need it, don't turn it on, because
            there will be at least a small performance degradation.  Default
            is OFF.
